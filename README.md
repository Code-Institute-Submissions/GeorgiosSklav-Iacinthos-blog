## Technologies and Tools demployed

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
   - For the whole project there were used various components included in **Bootstrap** such as 
     - ```navbar```&```dropdown```for the navigation menu
     - ```buttons```&```forms``` for the  *request form*
     - ```modal```for the *newsletter*

### Testing

Was achieved using [GoogleChrome's](https://www.google.com/chrome/) inspect tools for debugging.
While doing so discovered alterations in **media queries** so had to set them anew and a 503 error which is still present but doesn't affect the way the pages run.
Aslo, all the links and navigation were tested and aprooved by the breeder Mr. N.Davis as:
> Efficient and easy to read.

Furthermore, the website pages are responsive to different screen sizes and **WOULD NOT** disfigure any of it's content other than an _acceptable manner_ while changing devices.
